1. 1.  Get a count of files in a directory using the command line?
ls | wc -l

2. Remove white space from file name and replace white space with underscore. So file 'comp sci.txt' becomes 'comp_sci.txt'
for f in *; do mv "$f" `echo $f | tr ' ' '_'`; done

3. Commands to send files:

scp -r /media/ambi/DATA2/Research/GenomeSequencePaul/data ubuntu@137.205.69.27:/home/ubuntu/ambi/pangenomics

Copy the file "foobar.txt" from a remote host to the local host
$ scp your_username@remotehost.edu:foobar.txt /some/local/directory

Copy the file "foobar.txt" from the local host to a remote host
$ scp foobar.txt your_username@remotehost.edu:/some/remote/directory

Copy the directory "foo" from the local host to a remote host's directory "bar"
$ scp -r foo your_username@remotehost.edu:/some/remote/directory/bar

Copy the file "foobar.txt" from remote host "rh1.edu" to remote host "rh2.edu"
$ scp your_username@rh1.edu:/some/remote/directory/foobar.txt your_username@rh2.edu:/some/remote/directory/

Copy the directory "foo" from the remote to a local host
$ scp -r foo your_username@remotehost.edu:/some/remote/directory/bar
